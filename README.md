### Echo is a two-team project developed during the [Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-bootcamp).

It is a ReactJS web app designed to allow its users to search for and save Youtube videos to their profile and save specific time snippets to that, which they can later play in a loop.
